# FRC Test Code Repository Readme

Welcome to the FRC Test Code Repository - the place where robots and laughter collide! ðŸ¤–ðŸ˜‚

## What's Inside?

In this repository, you'll find a treasure trove of test code so bizarre that it might make your robot 
do the robot dance (or at least giggle).

## Prerequisites

- A robot (or at least an enthusiastic toaster)
- A computer capable of running code (preferably not a Commodore 64)
- A sense of humor (this is non-negotiable)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open your code editor.
3. Select the code file that appeals to your funny bone.
4. Deploy it to your robot (we cannot be held responsible for unexpected dance moves).
5. Enjoy the show!

## Contributors

This repository is maintained by a bunch of FRC enthusiasts who believe that robots, like people, 
deserve a little comic relief in their lives. If you've got a hilarious code snippet to add, feel free 
to join the party!

## Share Your Funny Failures

In the spirit of learning, we encourage you to share your funny robot failures, preferably with a video 
for maximum comedic effect. We believe that laughter is the best way to learn, and your "what NOT to 
do" moments can save other robotic souls from similar fiascos.

## Disclaimer

**WARNING**: Using this code on your competition robot may result in judges scratching their heads or 
disqualifying your robot for "excessive charm."

## Happy Testing!

Remember, the world needs more laughter and robots. So, happy testing, and let's see those bots boogie!
